## Framework Used

This template is powered by [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com) a material design framework based on [Google's material design spec](https://material.io/guidelines/material-design/introduction.html) and [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)

You should be familiar with both three technologies if you desire to edit the template.
